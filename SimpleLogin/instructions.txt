Project 5: User Registration & Login System (File I/O)

This project focuses heavily on Files (as a simple database), Strings, and Exception Handling related to file operations.

    Core Idea: A console app that lets a user register a new account or log in with an existing one. User data is saved to and read from a text file.

    Topics Used:

        Files: This is the core. You'll use:

            File.AppendAllText("users.txt", ...): To add a new user during registration.

            File.ReadAllLines("users.txt"): To get all users during login.

            File.Exists("users.txt"): To check if the file exists.

        Strings: You'll store user data as a simple CSV (Comma Separated Values) line, like "username,password\n". You'll use string.Split(',') to parse the line.

        Classes/Objects: Create a User class to hold the Username and Password after you read them from the file.

        Methods: Create void Register() and bool Login() methods.

        Exception Handling:

            Put your File.ReadAllLines call in a try-catch block.

            catch (FileNotFoundException): Handle the case where no one has registered yet.

            catch (IOException): Handle a generic error if the file is locked or unreadable.

        Logic (Loops, If/Else): The Login method will use a foreach loop to read each line from the file, Split it, and if the username/password match.
